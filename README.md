# CSE257-Decision-Trees
A repo for code used in my presentation for CSE 257, Fall 2021
Currently, contains code used for finding optimal decision trees with Simulated Annealing, using a simple synthetic dataset

One other dataset is used - a dataset on tic-tac-toe endgames. This originally comes from UCI, but the processed version was taken from https://github.com/aia-uclouvain/pydl8.5/blob/master/datasets/tic-tac-toe.txt with the columns explained at https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/CP4IM/datasets/data/tic-tac-toe.txt
